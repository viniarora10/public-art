# Department of Cultural Affairs  - Public Art Program KPI Generation 

## About

The Department of Cultural Affairs Public Art Division is in need of an analytic model to measure progress and demonstrate the impact of the Public Works Improvements Arts Program ([PWIAP](http://culturela.org/percent-public-art/public-works-improvements-arts-program-pwiap/)). PWIAP create arts amenities, facilities and services in connection with all City capital improvement projects. The Programâ€™s mission is to provide publicly accessible works of art, arts and cultural facilities, and services for the cultural benefit of the City, its citizens and its visitors. 

Since its inception 26 years ago, the Program has collected output and outcome data related to artist profile (ethnicity, gender, place of residence, degrees accomplished, artistic merit and experience), project finances (budget, expenditure, contractual employment), artworks (value of assets, locations/council district, launch date), community/stakeholder meetings, and partnered city departments and facilities.
